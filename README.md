## Firebase Configuration

Ensure you have a Firebase project set up. Replace the Firebase configuration in your code with the following in app.json extra:

```javascript
"extra": {
  "firebaseConfig" : {
    "apiKey": "your keys ",
    "authDomain": "your keys",
    "databaseURL": "your keys",
    "projectId": "your keys",
    "storageBucket": "your keys",
    "messagingSenderId": "your keys",
    "appId": "your keys",
  };
}
```

## App Flow

1. **Login Screen**:  
   Users enter their email and password to log in. If they donâ€™t have an account, they can navigate to the signup screen.

2. **Signup Screen**:  
   New users can create an account by providing their email, password, and any other required information.

3. **Home Screen**:  
   Once logged in, users are navigated to the home screen, which displays a list of users fetched from the Firebase database.

4. **User Detail Screen**:  
   Tapping on a user in the list navigates to the detail screen, where more information about the user is displayed.
